# tbilisi-microbus-routes
This is the postman collection and a simple Electron app for scraping, parsing and visualizing Tbilisi Microbus Routes data. All the data are from [tm.ge](https://tm.ge), which is outdated since the microbus numbers changed. Images below still describe density of microbus routes. Darker red areas correspond to overlapping routes. All the JSON data and visualization tools are still present, feel free to explore the repository.
